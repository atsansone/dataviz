              I work at the Texas Tribune as the Director of Technology.  We do
              a lot of data applications where we're munging data from different
              sources and turning it into something more useful for our readers.

            <aside class="notes">
              Most real-world data, as I'm describing it, is not a big data problem.
              Yes, if you're dealing with traffic sensors around Houston highway
              system and getting hundreds of data points every second from thousands
              of sensors, that's a big data problem.  If you're dealing with college
              readiness numbers from the <acronym title="Texas Edcation Agency">TEA</acronym>,
              that's not big data.

            <aside class="notes">
              Most of the data you get in these situations is dirty data.  Most likely,
              someone manually entered it and it most certainly had a human interact with
              it at some point.

            <h2>Unpredictable</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Because people are involved in producing most of this data, it's
                very unpredictable.  What was right yesterday when you pulled
                the data might not be true tomorrow.  Plan on the data being
                unpredictable and you'll safeguard your processes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Case in point, a few years ago I built the first version of the
                Texas Tribune bills tracker.  We started work on it in November
                and session started the first week of January.  I built everything
                up using the previous session (81st) as the model.  One of those
                pieces of data was that Senator Dan Patrick was always shown in
                their data as "Patrick, Dan".
              </p>

              <p>
                There were two Patricks in the legislature.  Dan Patrick was a
                senator and Diane Patrick was a representative.  Since there were
                two, they had their names adjusted to show that they were distinct.
                Or that's the way it was in the 81st Session.
              </p>

              <p>
                Starting the day after the 82nd Session kicked off, Dan
                Patrick's name was presented as Patrick.  Apparently, it was
                decided that senators should have just their last names
                displayed if there were no other senators that conflicted and
                representatives would get the Last, First treatment.

            <aside class="notes">
              Most of the data you're going to get is going to be limited in scope.
              You're normally going to have to combine multiple sources to get
              everything you're after, because...

            <aside class="notes">
              This is a plus.  Most big data problems have no upper bound.  Most
              real-world data represents something.  It's a set number of
              representatives or senators.  Texas only has so many counties.
              This gives you something to test against to make sure you've got
              everything you need.

              Whether you're writing a scraper or adjusting first/last orders in
              columns of a CSV, write a script for it.  It's ok to tinker with
              manual processes, but never use data that wasn't generated by a
              script.  It makes the process something you can duplicate.

              Data frequently disappears or changes in ways that can't fully be
              explained to those of us who think data should live forever.  Make
              sure to keep a copy of the original source data, whether that's

              have a horse in the race so the data they provide could be slanted.
              Government agencies could have a mandate that forces their hand in

              with.  Often, government data will have someone that's tweaking
              this data point, or adjusting that.  Make sure you understand
              where humans were involved with your data so you know where to

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Basically, know everything.  When you're working with real-world
                data, you need to understand everything about the data that
                you're processing.  It's not uncommon to have a row of data that
                looks perfectly valid, but column 221 has a special flag, that
                if set, means this data is junk and should be ignored.
              </p>

              <p>
                Make sure you grok the entire data set and don't make
                assumptions about it.

              There is going to be a time when you come back to your importer
              and go "why did I throw out columns 11-13?"  Make sure you're
              documenting your work and what you learned about the data.  Does
              column 221 provide a "junk" status on a column, make sure that's
              documented.  Code works, English is better.

              with the data.  Just admit it's going to change and be ready for

              provides pretty powerful tools for text processing.  Throw in
              NumPy and pandas for dealing with heavy statistical work, and it's

                Charles Proxy is great for dealing with websites that you need to
                reverse engineer.  Remember, you're scripting everything, so you
                want to be able to script retrieving the data too.

                Glimmer Blocker is interesting as a tool that you can use for
                unintended purposes.  It's meant to block sites and filter traffic,
                but it also provides logging.  You can set it up as the HTTP proxy
                for your phone, then all traffic will go through it and get logged.
                You can use it to "discover" hidden APIs to get at data that's hidden
                in mobile applications.
